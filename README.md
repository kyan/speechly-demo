# Simple Demo using the Speechly React library

This is a simple example using the [speechly react library](https://docs.speechly.com/).

To run this, you will need an App ID which you can get by creating a free account with [Speechly](https://api.speechly.com/dashboard/), and creating a new project and application. I'm currently just hardcording this App ID in the index.js file.

This project also contians some commented out code that uses the [react-speech-recognition](https://github.com/JamesBrill/react-speech-recognition) library. This library simply wraps the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API) functionality in a react hook.
